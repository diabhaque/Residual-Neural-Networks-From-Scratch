# Implement Residual Networks introduced by He et al, and ResNet50

Deep Neural networks with a lot of layers can be difficult to train due to the problem of vanishing/exploding gradients. ResNets work to ameliorate these issues.

Here, I write the basic building blocks of Residual Networks from scratch.
